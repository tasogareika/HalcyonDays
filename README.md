# UIStuff
UI stuff that became a working dialogue system for self.

Current mechanics
- Standard dialogue display
- reading dialogue off an .xml file
- switching between characters
- go to another dialogue tag (moving to new dialogue)
- enable insta start of new dialogue
- sprite switching for emotes etc.
- multiple choice response/answer
- animations for dialogue start/end
- Toggling of BGM/SFX
- Fading in/out of background to show scene change
